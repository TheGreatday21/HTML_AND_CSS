    <h3>For this website we are going to learn the different types of css</h3>
    <h5>Inline css</h5>
    <pre>this type of css that is applied to one given element at a time </pre>
    <br><br>
    <h5>Internal css</h5>
    <p>This involves using the style tags in the head section of the html file . Mainly used if the page has a unique design </p>
    <br><br>
    <h5>External css</h5>
    <pre>We use another file called a style sheet and link it to the html file in the head section using the link function </pre>
    <br><br>

    <!--the css properties include properties like: 1.tags, 2.classes, 3. ids  -->
    <!--selectors without a # or a dot are tags-->
    <!--Selectors with a dot are for classes and those with a # are for ids -->
    <!--we can edit the html from the css file with many annotations like font size, color, background color, -->
    <!--We also have the bar properties like the "nav-bar{}", "#title-bar{}"-->
